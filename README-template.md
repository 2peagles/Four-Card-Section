## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - React framework
- [Scsss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) - For styles

### What I learned

The mobile first approach definitely helped me! Then I was able to put in a media query for bigger screens much more easily.

As I was about to give up and ask for help, the thought crossed my mind: “just put it in a div, have that div span top to bottom, then center the content inside of that!” SOO freaking simple and I took an hour I think before I came to that conclusion..
